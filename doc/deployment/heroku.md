# Deployment on Heroku

Heroku is a Plattform as a Service (PaaS) Provider, which offers in their free-tier:

* one virtual machine (Dyno), which will go into idle-mode after one hour without a request
* a Postgres SQL DB
* many add-ons

You first have to setup an account with heroku and then use a deployment technique similar to the one described in [Deployment on OpenShift](openshift.md).
